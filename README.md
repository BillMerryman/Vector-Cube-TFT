# Vector-Cube-TFT

This project implements a new cube for the Vector robot that has a .85" TFT screen. It is intended to be used with the [Vector Cube Animation Editor] and by Vector himself through Wirepod by allowing him to send animations (made with the editor and stored as files) to the cube. You can view the STL files at [Vector Cube Customized With Screen].

The following demonstrations show:

+[A custom intent playing an animation on the cube].
+[A custom intent performing an image classification].
+[The animation editor manipulating and transmitting an animation].
