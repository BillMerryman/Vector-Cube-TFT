# Vector-Cube-TFT

This project implements a new cube for the Vector robot that has a .85" TFT screen. It is intended to be used with the [Vector Cube Animation Editor] and soon Vector himself by allowing him to send animations (made with the editor and stored as files) to the cube. This will be done in conjunction with Wirepod. You can view the STL files at [Vector Cube Customized With Screen].

Here it is responding to a [Custom Intent].
Here it is being used with the [Animation Editor].
